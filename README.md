## URL Shortener App Development

Please develop a simple URL shortener app. This app should be designed to create a short URL for a long (original) URL. The primary function of this app is to redirect users to the original URL when they click on the short URL. The idea isn't to build a shippable product, it's just to see your process. 

### Requirements

- Use Ruby On Rails
- Ability to enter a URL and get back a short URL
- The URL should be validated
- When the user hits a short link, the service should redirect to the original link
- Links will expire after a standard default time span
- Shortened links should not be predictable
- A very simple UI is fine

### Stretch Goals

- Short URL is automatically copied to the clipboard
- Basic analytics (number of times visited)
- API

### Note:

- Anything aside from the above, you're free to make assumptions.
- We will have a follow-up session for you to run through the thought process and the solution.
